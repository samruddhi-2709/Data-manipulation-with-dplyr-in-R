Data Manipulation with dplyr in R on Laptop Dataset

This project demonstrates data manipulation techniques using the dplyr package in R. The dataset used in this project is the Laptop Dataset, which contains information about various laptops, including their specifications, prices, and ratings.
The project showcases how to use dplyr's intuitive syntax to perform common data manipulation tasks, such as filtering rows based on specific conditions, selecting specific columns of interest.

By exploring the Laptop Dataset and applying dplyr functions, the project aims to provide a practical understanding of how to efficiently clean, reshape, and transform data for analysis or visualization purposes. The code examples and explanations included in the project can serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their data manipulation skills using dplyr in R.

The technology used in this project are R Programming Language,dplyr Package,Laptop Dataset & R Studio.

 These technologies work together to enable efficient data manipulation and analysis using the R programming language, specifically leveraging the capabilities of the dplyr package for handling and transforming the Laptop Dataset.
